# Sending emails


## Introduction
This documentation describes the installation, configuration and use of the Step Plugin for sending emails within a task in Goobi workflow. The list of recipients and the text can be configured individually for different steps. All fields from the VariableReplacer are also available. This means that metadata or information on the task, step or project can also be accessed.

## How the plugin works
The plugin is usually executed fully automatically within the workflow. It first determines whether there is a block in the configuration file that has been configured for the current workflow with regard to the project name and work step. If this is the case, the mail is generated and sent to the configured recipients.


## Operation of the plugin
This plugin is integrated into the workflow in such a way that it is executed automatically. Manual interaction with the plugin is not necessary. For use within a workflow step, it should be configured as shown in the screenshot below.

        4.) project name and step name are *
    -->
    <config>
        <!-- which projects to use for (can be more then one, otherwise use *) -->
        <project>*</project>
        <step>*</step>

        <smtpServer>example.com</smtpServer>
        <smtpUseStartTls>false</smtpUseStartTls>
        <smtpUseSsl>true</smtpUseSsl>

        <!-- displayed sender address -->

        <receiver>user@example.com</receiver>
        <receiver>second-user@example.com</receiver>
