# Single Page Export

## Introduction

This plugin is used for a special export of multiple METS files per process. From a single METS file within Goobi workflow, a separate METS file with the associated image files is created during the export for each structural element contained.

This plugin was developed for the Federal Office for the Protection of Monuments in Austria and is functionally geared to their needs and therefore may not be directly applicable to other use cases.

## Installation

The plugin consists of the following files to be installed:

```
plugin_intranda_export_bdaSingleImage.jar
```

This file must be installed in the following directory:

```bash
/opt/digiverso/goobi/plugins/export/plugin_intranda_export_bdaSingleImage.jar
```

## Configuration

This plugin does not have its own configuration file.

## Integration of the plugin into the workflow

To put the plugin into operation, it must be activated for one or more desired tasks in the workflow. This is done as shown in the following screenshot by selecting the plugin `intranda_export_singleImage` from the list of installed plugins.

![Assigning the plugin to a specific task](../.gitbook/assets/intranda\_export\_bda\_singleImage\_en.png)

Since this plugin should usually be executed automatically, the workflow step should be configured as `automatic`. In addition, the task must be marked as an export step.

## How the plugin works

Once the plugin has been fully installed and set up, it is usually run automatically within the workflow, so there is no manual interaction with the user. Instead, calling the plugin through the workflow in the background does the following:

For each structural element within the METS file, an independent METS file is created during the export, to which the respective image files are exported along with it. The entire METS file is not exported. The number of METS files created in this way differs accordingly from the number of Goobi processes and corresponds to the number of existing structural elements.
